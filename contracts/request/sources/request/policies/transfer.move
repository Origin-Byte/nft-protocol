/// We interoperate with the sui ecosystem by allowing our `TransferRequest` to
/// be converted into the sui version.
/// This is only possible for the cases where the payment is done in SUI token.
///
/// Our transfer request offers generics over fungible token.
/// We are no longer limited to SUI token.
/// Royalty policies can decide whether they charge a fee in other tokens.
///
/// Our transfer request associates paid balance with the request.
/// This enables us to do permissionless transfers of NFTs.
/// That's because we store the beneficiary address (e.g. NFT seller) with the
/// paid balance.
/// Then when confirming a transfer, we transfer this balance to the seller.
/// With special capability, the policies which act as a middleware can access
/// the balance and charge royalty from it.
/// Therefore, a 3rd party to a trade can send a tx to finish it.
/// This is helpful for reducing # of txs users have to send for trading
/// logic which requires multiple steps.
/// With our protocol, automation can be set up by marketplaces.

/// This creates a new transfer request policy to which rules can be attached.
/// Some common rules:
/// * `nft_protocol::allowlist::enforce`
/// * `nft_protocol::royalty_strategy_bps::enforce`
