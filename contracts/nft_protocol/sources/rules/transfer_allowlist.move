/// Allowlists NFT transfers.
///
/// This module is a set of functions for implementing and managing a
/// allowlist for NFT (non-fungible token) transfers.
/// The allowlist is used to authorize which contracts are allowed to
/// transfer NFTs of a particular collection.
/// The module includes functions for creating and managing the allowlist,
/// adding and removing collections from the allowlist, and checking whether
/// a contract is authorized to transfer a particular NFT.
/// The module uses generics and reflection to allow for flexibility in
/// implementing and managing the allowlist.
///
/// Generics at play:
/// 1. Admin (allowlist witness) enables any organization to start their own
///     allowlist and manage it according to their own rules;
/// 2. Auth (3rd party witness) is used to authorize contracts via their
///     witness types. If e.g. an orderbook trading contract wants to be
///     included in a allowlist, the allowlist admin adds the stringified
///     version of their witness type. The OB then uses this witness type
///     to authorize transfers.
