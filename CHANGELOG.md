  `T` represents the exported NFT type and `M` the market type
- `Slingshot` module has entrypoints `claim_nft_embedded` and `claim_nt_loose`
- `std_collection::mint_and_transfer` function now expected `u64` for field `max_supply` instead of `Option<u64>` to facilitate function call on the client side
