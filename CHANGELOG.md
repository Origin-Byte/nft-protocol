[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.21.0] - 2023-02-02

### Changed

- Updated Sui dep to `0.24.0`

## [0.20.0] - 2023-01-26

### Added

- `PluginDomain` which collects type names of witness structs.
  These then serve to authorize a function in a "base" contract (the one that is deployed with the one-time-witness type.)
  The function returns the original witness type (of the same module as the OTW) in exchange for a witness of another smart contract (a plugin) if that plugin's witness is present in the `PluginDomain`.
- `Multisig` is a utility struct which enables smart contracts to authorize
  actions signed by predefined set of accounts.

### Changed

- Adding a creator now accepts a mutable reference to the collection instead of
  the `CreatorDomain`.
  This is because getting the reference to the `CreatorDomain` required a `&mut TxContext`.
  The same reference was required in the `add_creator` function.
- Orderbook event `AskCreatedEvent`/`BidCreatedEvent` are emitted when
  creating a new position in orderbook.
- Orderbook event `AskClosedEvent`/`BidClosedEvent` are emitted when
  closing a position in orderbook.
- Orderbook event `TradeFilledEvent` is emitted when a trade is filled.
  That is, either on `create_bid`/`create_ask` when the trade is immediately
  filled, or on `buy_nft`/`buy_generic_nft`.
- Royalties event when `TradePayment` is created.

### Changed
- Updated Sui dep to `0.23.0`
- Renamed `Inventory` to `Warehouse`

### Fixed

- When creating a bid higher than the lowest ask, the bid is now filled with
  the lowest ask price. Before, it was filled with the bid price.

## [0.19.1] - 2023-01-23

### Changed

- Updated Sui dep to `0.22.1`

## [0.19.0] - 2023-01-13

### Changed

- Updated Sui dep to `0.22.0`

### Removed

- `CreatorsDomain` no longer has `is_frozen` flag as it needs to be
  reconstructed when edited, and it can be dropped when no longer needed.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-01-13

### Changed

- Orderbook and bidding liquidity layer contracts now support 3rd party
  collections, ie. those which are not build with `nft-protocol` primitives.
  These collections must implement their own royalty enforcement policies if
  they wish so.
- `TransferCap` exposes information about whether an NFT is a generic or native
  to our protocol.
- `safe::deposit_generic_nft_privileged`
- Refactored RoyaltyDomain and CreatorsDomain to split royalty share and authorization logic.
- Added entry function redeem_nft_transfer thus allowing creators to retrieve NFTs from private `Inventory`.
- Updated Sui dep to `0.21.0`

## [0.17.0] - 2022-12-19

### Changed

- Updated Sui dep to `0.20.0`

## [0.16.0] - 2023-01-03

### Changed

- Renaming `whitelist` to `allowlist` in relation to transferring NFTs.
- We maintain our own version of `movemate` dependency called `originmate`.
- Markets (`FixedPriceMarket`, `DutchAuctionMarket`) are now registered on `Inventory` rather than the `Slot`.
- Live and whitelisted status of markets is now tracked on `Inventory`.
- Market access permissions rearranged to use more direct `inventory_internal_mut`.
- Renamed `Launchpad` to `Marketplace` and `Slot` to `Listing`
- `Listing`s can not be create independent of `Marketplace`. They can operate independently or be attached to a `Marketplace` subsequent to its creation
- Renamed `AttributionDomain` to `CreatorsDomain`

## [0.15.0] - 2022-12-22

### Added

- Creating an ask with commission in the orderbook returns an error if the
  commission is greater equal to the ask price.
- `Safe` can now be used to transfer NFTs to a `Safe` which are not wrapped in
  the `nft_protocol::nft::Nft` type.
  These NFTs have lower guarantees when it comes to transfers.
  Enables us to integrate other standards.
- NFT minting can now be done privately to an `Inventory` object and only
  after transfered to a launchpad `Slot`

### Changed

- Renamed some arguments in the orderbook to be more descriptive.

### Removed

- Some protected actions were entry methods. This did not make sense because
  witness shouldn't have the `key` ability and therefore cannot be an entry
  function argument.

## [0.14.0] - 2022-12-20

### Changed

- New version of the protocol
- The core `Nft` type now has the fields `bag` and `logical_owner` where bag is used to add any domain to the NFT
- Changed Launchpad design to fit the business model of Marketplaces, where marketplaces and dApps can now deploy a Launchpad and NFT creators can launch their collections on such Launchpads by creating a Launchpad Slot.
- Launchpad Admin can define the `default_fee` on a launchpad sale
- If `launchpad.is_permissioned == true`, then only `launchpad.admin` can add `slots`, otherwise anyone can add `slots`
- Launchpad admins can attach custom fee policies to each Slot
- Proceeds coming from launchpad sales are collected in the struct `Proceeds`, and to unwrap the funds off this struct we guarantee fee collection enforcement.
- Name of the `deposit_nft_priviledged` was changed to `deposit_nft_privileged`.

### Added

- Domain standards for NFT Collections to use, such as `display`, `attribution`, `tags`, `royalties` and `flyweight`
- `Safe` module that holds NFTs on behalf of the owner and can delegate transferability via `TransferCap` and `ExclusiveTransferCap`
- Trading primitives modules such as `bidding` contract and `orderbook` contract

### Removed

- Removed `unique_nft`, `collectible` and `c_nft` modules as configurability now occurs on the type-exporting NFT collection module
