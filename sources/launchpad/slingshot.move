//! Module of a generic `Slingshot` type.
//! 
//! It acts as a generic interface for Launchpads and it allows for
//! the creation of arbitrary domain specific implementations.
//! 
//! The slingshot acts as the object that configures the primary NFT realease
//! strategy, that is the primary market sale. Primary market sales can take
//! many shapes, depending on the business level requirements.
