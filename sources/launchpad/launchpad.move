//! Module of a `Launchpad` type.
//!
//! Launchpads are platforms that facilitate the release of NFT collections
//! to the public, via primary market. Whilst NFT creators can emit NFTs
//! directly and thus bypass the `Launchpad`, the `Launchpad` offers a myriad
//! of bespoke emission strategies.
//!
//! Launchapds can either be Permissioned or Permissionless. Marketplaces and
//! dApps that want to offer a launchpad service can create a Permissioned
//! Launchpad. In a permissioned model, the Marketplace or dApp is responsible
//! for making and signing all the RPC calls to configure and implement the
//! release strategy. If the launchpad is permissionless, then the creators
//! are the ones responsible for configuring and implementing it themselves.
//! In other words, permissioned launchpads allow for the creation of
//! fully manager services, whilst permissionless launchpads always require
//! the creator's signature.
//!
//! After the creation of the `Launchpad` a `Slot` for the NFT release needs
//! to be created. Whilst the `Launchpad` stipulates a default fee policy,
//! the launchpad admin can decide to create a custom fee policy for each
//! release `Slot`.
//!
//! The slot acts as the object that configures the primary NFT release
//! strategy, that is the primary market sale. Primary market sales can take
//! many shapes, depending on the business level requirements.
