//! Module of a Fixed Price Sale `Market` type.
//! 
//! It implments a fixed price launchpad configuration.
//! 
//! NFT creators can decide if they want to create a simple primary market sale
//! via `create_single_market` or if they want to create a tiered market sale
//! by segregating NFTs by different sale segments (e.g. based on rarity).
//! 
//! Each sale segment can have a whitelisting process, each with their own
//! whitelist tokens.
//! 
//! TODO: Consider if we want to be able to delete the launchpad object
//! TODO: Remove code duplication between `buy_nft_certificate` and
//! `buy_whitelisted_nft_certificate`
